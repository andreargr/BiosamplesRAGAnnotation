I need the identifier to be as closely related to the label as possible.
For each label, search for an appropriate IRI in the CLO,CL,UBERON, and BTO ontology, using the example identifiers.
The input details for your task are as follows:

**Label:**
{label}

Each label will be related to biological samples like cell lines, cell types and anatomy structures.

These are proposals of IRIs to use for the label:
**Identifiers:**
{identifiers_examples}

Strictly structure your output in the following format:
[CLO_0000000, CL_0000000, UBERON_0000000, BTO_0000000]

If you consider that any of the identifiers for a given ontology is not appropriate, replace it with "-", like the next example:
[CLO_0000000, -, UBERON_0000000, -]

The identifier is formed by the acronym of the ontology it comes from (CLO,CL,UBERON or BTO) and the number code for example: CLO_0000000.

Generate appropriate identifiers.
Do not explain your answer, just write the identifiers.
Do not write notes at the end of your writing.
